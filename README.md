`native-clone` provides `cloneSync()` and `cloneAsync()` methods wrapping
native/built-in implementations of the HTML5 Structured Clone algorithm, as
[described in this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10916838).

If no suitable built-in implementation is available, an error will be thrown.
